(** 1. Environments *)


(** We represent the environment using maps.  (For short programs, we could
   use lists, but large programs with modules, may have quite large
   contexts.)  We separate the name spaces of expression variables [evar]
   from type variables, hence using a separate map.

   For type variables, we actually need two maps: [svar] maps source type
   variables (which may be shadowed) to internal type variables while [cvar]
   maps internal type variables (which are never shadowed) to their kind or
   definition.

   You may need to add another map in type [env] for Task 4.  *)
                    
type env = {
    evar : ctyp Senv.t;
    svar : cvar Senv.t;
    cvar : kind Tenv.t;
}

let empty_env = {
    evar = Senv.empty;
    svar = Senv.empty;
    cvar = Tenv.empty;
}

(** Functions to query the environment accordingly. Same semantics as maps,
   except for the order of arguments. All `find_` functions raise the
   exception [Not_found] when their argument is not in the environment. *)
let find_cvar env a =  Tenv.find a env.cvar
let find_evar env x = Senv.find x env.evar
let find_svar env s = Senv.find s env.svar

(** Functions to modify the environment accordingly. Same semantics as maps,
   except for the order of arguments. *)
let add_evar env x t = { env with evar = Senv.add x t env.evar }
let add_cvar env a k = { env with cvar = Tenv.add a k env.cvar }

(** [add_svar] must also deal with shallow bindings *)
let add_svar env s a = { env with svar = Senv.add s a env.svar }


(** [fresh_id_for env a] returns the smallest possible id for variable name
   [a] given the already allocated variables in [env]. Depending on the
   implementation, it may need to store information in env, hence it returns
   a possibly modified version of [env] *)

(** Assuming source type variables never end with an integer, a simple correct 
    implementation of [fresh_id_for] *)
let fresh_id_for_T1 env _a =
  env, fresh_id ()

(** Assuming source type variables never end with an integer, a simple and more
    readable correct implementation of [fresh_id_for] *)
let fresh_id_for_T2 env _a =
  let id = 
    try
      (find_svar env _a).id + 1
    with
      | Not_found -> 0
  in
  add_svar env _a { name = _a ; id ; def = None }, id

let fresh_id_for =
     fresh_id_for_T2

(** [get_svar env a] is a wrapper around [find_evar env a] that turns a
   [Not_found] exception into a non-localized [Unbound] typing-error
   exception.  These will have to be localized by their calling context,
   using [within_loc]. *)
let get_svar env a =
  try find_svar env a
  with Not_found -> error_unloc (Unbound (Typ (None, a)))
                  
(** May raise non-localized [Unbound] error *)
let get_evar exp env x =
  try find_evar env x
  with Not_found -> error exp (Unbound (Exp x))

(** 2. Type minimization *)

(** Type checking must perform computation on types when checking for
   convertibilty.  This requires appropriate renamaing to avaid capture,
   hence generating many fresh variables, which may then disappear during
   reduction.  The resulting type may thefore use large integer suffixes,
   which are unpleasant for the user to read.

   For this reason, we minimize variable names after typechecking each
   declaration, and before printing error messages.  We take advantage of
   this to allow chose possibly large intergers when renaming local
   variables during computation on types, given that this will be minimized
   after computation.

   (We could use this to further optimize maps, using just some additional
   [uid] integer field for identificatiion instead of the pair [name] nad [id].)
*)


(** [minimize_typ env t] returns a renaming of [t] that minimizes the
   variables suffixes but still avoids shallowing internally and with
   respect to env [env] *)
let rec minimize_typ env t =
  t (* fix me *)

(** [do_minimize] tells whether types should be minimized. It defaults to
   [true] and may be changed with the `--rawtypes` command line option, *)
let do_minimize = spec_true "--rawtypes"  "Do not minimize types"

let minimize_typ env t =
  if !do_minimize then minimize_typ (env, Tenv.empty) t else t

(** [type_typ env t] typechecks source type [t] returning its kind [k] and
   an internal representation of [t].  This may non-localized (Unbound and
   Kinding) typing error exceptions. *)
let rec type_typ env (t : styp) : kind * ctyp =
  match t with
  | Tprim  c -> 
     Ktyp, Tprim c
  | _ -> failwith "not implemented" 

(** Checking that lovcal variable do not escape.  Typechecking of
   existential types requires that locally abstract variables do not escape
   from their scope.  This amounts to verifying that the returned type is
   well-formed.  It suffices to check that all variables are bound in the
   given environment.

   One must be careful of non linear redexes and delayed definitions.
   Therefore, we must not only check for well-formedness, but return an
   equivalent type that is well-formed.  This should just perform the
   necessary unfoldings and reductions.  *)
